# Evolution for everyone
This is a project where I will attempt to simulate evolution (or at least, some miniscule parts of it).<br>
In this project, I will try to make a modular program where users can tweak as many options as possible.

For more interesting things (through which I got the idea to make this), see the following links:
* [Evolution simulator]
* Probably more things
