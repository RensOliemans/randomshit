### Goals of the Evolution Simulator

* Simulating Evolution. The way it will attempt to do that is explained in `explanations.md`
* Being modular: allowing users to tweak certain values or constants to change the process;
* Being understandable: the results are
    - Logical,
    - Reproducable (within certain limits, as a lot of randomness plays part) and
    - Viewable - the results should be possible to view in any way
    (Graphical UI, Textual UI, or anything that seems logical)

The goals of the evolution simulator are of course, always up to change.
